# RANSAC-java

Using the object-oriented paradigm, I implemented an algorithm that will detect the dominant planes in a cloud of 3D points. The dominant plane of a set of 3D points is the plane that contains the largest number of points. A 3D point is contained in a plane if it is located at a distance less than eps (ε) from that plane. To detect these planes, the RANSAC algorithm will be used.
